GRNboost_ is an `Apache Spark`_ library for inferring `gene regulatory networks`_ (GRNs) from next
generation sequencing data.

GRNBoost_ was inspired by the machine-learning approach proposed by GENIE3_, a popular (200+ citations)
algorithm for the inference of GRNs and top performer in two DREAM_ challenges. GENIE3_'s inference strategy is
simple but remarkably effective. It breaks up the construction of a full GRN into a number of regressions,
one for each target gene, in function of a collection of candidate regulating genes (transcription factors).
The regressions are performed using tree-based ensemble learning algorithms (`Random Forest`_ or `ExtraTrees`_).
From each regression model, the input features (regulating genes) with highest importance are selected as
candidate regulators for the target gene. Finally, all regulatory links with sufficient importance are collected
into the final putative regulatory network.

GRNBoost_ aims at providing a scalable and computationally performant alternative for GENIE3_. GENIE3_'s
multiple regression approach represents a so-called `embarrassingly parrallel`_ workload. This immediately
suggests the extrapolation from using multiple threads -- one per regression -- on a single machine, to
a distributed_ MapReduce_ approach, where regressions are spread out over multiple compute nodes. GRNBoost_
uses `Apache Spark`_ to coordinate the regressions and aggregate their inference results.
Secondly, motivated by improving the speed of computation of a single regression, GRNBoost_ replaces the
regression algorithm by XGBoost_, a highly performant and currently state-of-the-art `ensemble learning`_ algorithm.
XGBoost_ uses boosting_ to combine weak learners, typically (shallow) decision trees, into a strong learner.

GRNBoost_ is written in the Scala_ programming language and `available on Github`_ under the TODO license.

.. It is mainly intended as a `Spark job`_, accepting application arguments like a command-line application.

.. A considerable amount of thought went into the design and structure of the software library, enabling its
    use in a notebook environment like `Apache Zeppelin`_.
